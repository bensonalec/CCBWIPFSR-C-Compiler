                    We are tasked with creating a compiler for a subset of the C programming language. With this challenge includes figuring out how to implement the three fundamental parts of any compiler: Frontend, Optimization, and the Backend. Our goal with this project is not only to design and implement an optimizing compiler, but to strengthen our ability to design and create software that achieves its purpose and provides adequate documentation to explain how it operates.

                    Our compiler can be split into three major stages that takes
                    in a C program and converts this "High-Level" language into
                    many different forms of Intermediate Representations (IR's)
                    until it reaches the point of assembly code.

                            Responsible for scanning and assigning tokens to
                            different elements of our C program, this module was
                            designed using RPLY's lexer class. By simply adding in
                            tokens to our lexer we are able to give it a string version
                            of our C program and get a list of all valid tokens.

                                    Currently the only known errors we can experience
                                    while using RPLY's lexer library is when we encounter
                                    an element that isn't recognized. By adding an <code>INVALID</code>
                                    token type, and having it match to any string combination,
                                    we eliminate the possibility of the imported lexer code to
                                    fail, and are able to report any invalid tokens to the user.

                                This sub-module relies on RPLY's parser generator but still
                                requires a grammar. After defining a grammar in a separate
                                file we can construct a parser using RPLY syntax that will
                                take in the grammar and build our Parse Tree. Currently RPLY
                                has allowed us to impliment a "Bottom-up left-to-right" parser.

                                Using the initial Parse Tree, we are able to shorten it down and "abstract" it to have
                                a more understandable and syntax-free way to represent a C program. We currently have a single
                                function, <code>buildAST(parseTreeHead)</code>, that constructs a series of <code>ASTNode</code> objects
                                with references to each other. Represented in the correct way, this creates a "Tree" data type.

                                            Every AST produced by our compiler will start with <code>program</code> denoting the root
                                            of the C program. Following this root, there could be a series of function prototypes, <code>decl</code>,
                                            and function declarations, <code>func</code>. Whether it be a prototype or declaration there will always be 3
                                            branches that describe the Type, Function-Name, and Function-Parameters. In the case of a declaration, an extra node marked <code>body</code>
                                            will link to the actual body of the function. Other keywords such as <code>var</code> (variables), <code>call</code> (function calls), and
                                            arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, etc.) exist in the produced AST if such content exists in the original C program.

                                            By constructing a symbol table using our AST, it becomes a lot easier to perform analysis on the C program.
                                            This table contains properties such as:

                                            Along with all the "Known" symbols we also store the "Unknown" symbols which would cause warnings to be

                                    For our IR, we decided to closely mimic Gimple, the IR used by GCC. In designing it, we aimed to keep as close as possible, but with the design decisions that made out lives easier in the long run. The basis of our optimization compenent of the compiler is converting one IR, the abstract syntax tree, to another, linear, IR. The resultant IR is then used to construct the assembly code in the Backend. The compiler as a whole allows for a few methods of interaction that all result in the linear IR. Building it from the AST and the symbol table or importing it through the commandline. In addition to this, the compiler does allow for a flag to specify the level of optimization that will be performed on the input.

                                            The linear IR is structured in a way that all we have to do is to interact with the concept of a singular hypothetical line in the IR. This line may or may not boil down to multiple sub-lines called <code>IRNode</code>. Each <code>IRNode</code> would represent close to one assembly instruction with a few exception. This allows us to generalize over the IR as a whole when it comes to converting it to assembly. The design decision to have different IR instructions as their individual data type (that inherit from same parent class), was to have a way of storing these instructions not as a String yet still having a way to be converted to a String for visual representation. The types of nodes that we have defined goes as follows:
                                            <dl>
                                                <dt>IRJump</dt>

                                                    This node represents a label for a goto statement in the IR, for instance it’s string representation:<br>
                                                    <pre><code>label:</code></pre>

Each of these smaller building blocks can be seen above. There are cases where each <code>IRLine</code> only contains a singular building block, but in those cases there are special circumstances that require that to happen such as closing and opening of scopes through the use of the <code>IRBracket</code> class.

We designed our own grammar and convert the output to the same format as something that was built through the use of a valid C file. This allows us to perform the same optimizations on the imported IR as the IR that is generated from a C file.

                                                levels. <code>-O0</code> means that no optimization occurs during the compilation process. <code>-O1</code> means
                                                that there are slight optimizations done during the compilation process. <code>-O2</code> means that there are more
                                                advanced optimizations done during the compilaion process. Keep in mind that they are by no means agressive, and
                                                there is no risk of altered behavior of the program when using these optimizations.<br>

    Since our IR was converted to a series of nodes that represent each IR line type we expect, we can leverage that same IRNode class in order to generate our initial assembly. This initial assembly still uses variable names instead of registers, and we then do proper register allocation in the next "phase". 
    Each IRNode class has a corresponding function, called "asm", that uses the built IRNode that has already been built in our previous optimization step, and uses the information stored in it to convert it to an assembly representation. 
    
    In these "asm" functions we build a list of ASMNodes, another class we have defined, and return that list of ASMNodes. Then, we call the asm function on each IRNode that is produced via our optimization step, and append the list that each asm function returns to a master list. This master list is then passed into a class called allocator, that does register allocation.
    
                                    <dl>
                                        <dt><h5>ASMNode</h5></dt>
                                        <dd>
                                        The ASMNode class creates an object with a series of variables that determine important information for the register allocation step. The class expects an op, left, right and a kwargs dictionary.  A series of useful flags are passed in as the dictionary kwargs to the initialization of an ASMNode, and then the initializaiton goes through this dictionary to set the appropriate flags for the new ASMNode. 
    
                                        It stores most instructions in the general form of "op left, right", and for some nodes the left and right can be none. 
    
                                        Some examples of flags om the class include "leftNeedsReg", which indicates that in register allocation we will need to allocate a register for the left operand of the given ASMNode, and the flag "leftIsLiteral", which indicates that the left operand of the ASMNode is a literal (i.e $4). (There are various other flags, thesea are just two examples.)

                                The register allocation step uses a class called "allocator" in order to go through a list of ASMNodes that is passed in, and then modify their left and right operands to be replaced by the appropriate registers where necessary. In order to do this, it separates the different scenarios where different register allocations need to be done by making a series of "cases", each of which is determined by the flags set in the ASMNode class. Then, in these cases it uses a class that represents a directory of registers, and a registerData class to determime what registers are open, and what is in those registers at what given time. As well as this, we implemented a stack class, which is used to mimic the stack in x64 assembly, and move things on, off, and determine what is where in the stack. Finally, after register allocation, the class returns a new list of ASMNodes, with some new additions that are necessary for the register allocation, and the variables in the initial list changed to the appropriate registers.
