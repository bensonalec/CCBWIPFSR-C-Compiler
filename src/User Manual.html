        <p>We are tasked with creating a compiler for a subset of the C programming
                language. With this challenge includes figuring out how to implement the
                three fundamental parts of any compiler: Frontend, Optimization, and the
                Backend. Our goal with this project is not only to design and implement
                an optimizing compiler, but to strengthen our ability to design and create
                software that achieves its purpose and provides adequate documentation to
                explain how it operates.</p>

<h3>How to use the compiler</h3>
The compiler is split up into three modules, the frontend, the optimizer, and the backend.<br>
So far only the frontend is implemented, and can so far only be executed by running the <code>frontend.py</code> located in <code>./src/frontend</code>.<br>
The frontend supports a variety of commandline options such as:
<dl>
        <dt><code>-a</code></dt>
        <dd>Displays all intermediate outputs produced by both the lexer and parser.</dd>
        <dt><code>-b</code></dt>
        <dd>Allows for rebuilding of BNF grammar and parser before the frontend touches the input.</dd>
        <dt><code>-h</code></dt>
        <dd>Displays the help message.</dd>
        <dt><code>-l</code></dt>
        <dd>Prints out the tokens produced by the lexer in a list.</dd>
        <dt><code>-p</code></dt>
        <dd>Prints a tree structure of the tokens after they have been parsed.</dd>
        <dt><code>-t</code></dt>
        <dd>Prints a list like tree structure of the tokens after they have been parsed.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Subset of C supported</h3>
The plan is to support the whole set of C instructions for as much of the compilation process as possible. As such here is a table of what parts of the compiler supports what features:<br>
<table>
        <tr>
                <th>Feature</th>
                <th>Preprocessor</th>
                <th>Lexer</th>
                <th>Parser</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>Variable declaration</td>
                <td>NA</td>
                <td>&#x2714;</td>
                <td>&#x2714;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>Pointer declaration</td>
                <td>NA</td>
                <td>&#x2715;</td>
                <td>&#x2715;</td>
        </tr>
</table>
