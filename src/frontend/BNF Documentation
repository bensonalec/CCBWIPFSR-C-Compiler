DESIGN DESCRIPTION:
	Basically, at this point it has a program that is the top level, this expects a single function definition. Inside of this function definition, 
	currently this supports return statements and function calls. Inside of these function calls, currently only arithmetic expressions are supported

Clarification on something: Content is stuff that is inside of function definitions, expression is stuff that is inside of function calls. Obviously 
when implementing stuff like if/else, etc you might need to build another case other than content or expression



TODO:
	-Figure out how to make stuff variatic (Ex. in the program definition above, make it take in multiple function definitions)
	-Change program definition to take in other stuff (Preprocessors, etc.)
	BASE FEATURES (REQUIRED)
	-Implement content for variable definition
	-Implement content for Arithmetic expressions (Kind of exists now, need to make it a content section)
